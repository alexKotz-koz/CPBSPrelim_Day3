Download Biosamples:
1. Install sratoolkit via homebrew: brew install sratoolkit
2. Fetch the two biosamples (smallest WGS sequences from the bioproject):
    - 'prefetch SRR'
    - 'fastq-dump <sra file>'
    - Note: These files, by default, will download into a directory named 'ncbi' at the root of your file system. 
- SRR24581285: cryoconite 
    - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX20364643[accn]
- SRR24581281: biofilm
    - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX20364649

Download Viral Data:
1. Download 2000 random viruses from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide
    - 6000 random viruses were downloaded for the development and testing of this project
    b. Download the Nucleocytoviricota refseq genomes from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Genome&VirusLineage_ss=Nucleocytoviricota,%20taxid:2732007
        - These are the viruses that were found in the red snow alge from: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-024-01796-y
