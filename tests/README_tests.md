## Notes on Testing
- All tests can be run under the test_suite.py script, to do this:
1. Change directory from root to tests
```sh
cd tests
```
2. Run test suite
```sh
python3 test_suite.py
```

- Tests were not created for codeReport.py and viromeReport.py due to visualization components in these scripts
